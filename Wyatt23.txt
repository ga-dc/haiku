Haiku
Adrian Wyatt 

Can only find one
Morning rush, coffee spilling
dryer ate my sock

Have to drive to work
Seduced by blooms on the boughs
What if I kept driving…

Heard someone singing
Tried to reach out and I missed
Mermaids are fishy

Dried roses were yours
On my wall, they make me sneeze
Still won’t throw them out.

Pearls or red lipstick?
She is choosing her weapons
Poor boy, we’ll miss him.
