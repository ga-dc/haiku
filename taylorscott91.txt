I cannot decide
On which haiku to give you:
So you get these six:

Five syllables here.
Seven more syllables there;
Five more syllables.

Coding is easy.
Hang on what is JavaScript
Oh God what the heck

Haikus are easy.
Say some words that sound quite nice,
like watermelon.

Pow! Crash! Bang! Whiz! Zoom!
Itâ€™s onomatopoeia,
the language of sounds.

Fragrant spring flowers
Wafting through the gentle breeze
Of a sunny day

So that last haiku
Was stereotypical
Of most all haikus.

How about I write
Some unusual haikus?
Oh wait, just did that.

I just realized
My intro haiku was wrong -
I wrote eight, not six!
