Yosa Buson (with additional changes)

Three examples of the haiku of Yosa Buson from the late 1700s are offered here:

A summer river being crossed
how pleasing

with sandals in my hands!



Light of the moon

Moves west, flowers' shadows

Creep eastward.



In the moonlight,

The color and scent of the wisteria

Seems far away.
